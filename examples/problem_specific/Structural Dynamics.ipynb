The **uncertainty bounds** around the estimated states are noticeable, especially early in the domain.

The uncertainty bounds here are narrower, showing that the confidence improves as the filter incorporates observations of these quantities of interest (i.e. accelerations).\n",

This is expected because accelerations, being the directly observed quantities, are estimated with higher confidence.
