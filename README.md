# Overview

`RxInfer.jl` is a Julia package for automatic Bayesian inference on a factor graph with reactive message passing.

Given a probabilistic model, RxInfer allows for an efficient message-passing based Bayesian inference. It uses the model structure to generate an algorithm that consists of a sequence of local computations on a factor graph representation of the model.

> [!NOTE]
> RxInfer can also be used from Python through our [client-server infrastructure](#client-server-infrastructure) and [Python SDK](https://github.com/lazydynamics/RxInferClient.py).

### Performance and scalability

RxInfer.jl has been designed with a focus on efficiency, scalability and maximum performance for running Bayesian inference with message passing. Below is a comparison between RxInfer.jl and Turing.jl on latent state estimation in a linear multi-variate Gaussian state-space model. [Turing.jl](https://github.com/TuringLang/Turing.jl) is a state-of-the-art Julia-based general-purpose probabilistic programming package and is capable of running inference in a broader class of models. Still, RxInfer.jl executes the inference task in [various models](https://examples.rxinfer.com) faster and more accurately. RxInfer.jl accomplishes this by taking advantage of any conjugate likelihood-prior pairings in the model, which have analytical posteriors that are known by RxInfer.jl. As a result, in models with conjugate pairings, RxInfer.jl often beats general-purpose probabilistic programming packages in terms of computational load, speed, memory and accuracy. Note, however, that RxInfer.jl also supports non-conjugate inference and is continually improving in order to support a larger class of models.

### Faster inference with better results

RxInfer.jl not only beats generic-purpose Bayesian inference methods in conjugate models, executes faster, and scales better, but also provides more accurate results. Check out more examples [here](https://examples.rxinfer.com)!

The benchmark and accuracy experiment, which generated these plots, is available in the `benchmarks/` folder. Note, that the execution speed and accuracy 
of the HMC estimator heavily depends on the choice of hyperparameters. 
In this example, RxInfer executes exact inference consistently and does not depend on any hyperparameters.

### Coin flip simulation

Here we show a simple example of how to use RxInfer.jl for Bayesian inference problems. In this example we want to estimate a bias of a coin in a form of a probability distribution in a coin flip simulation.

First let's setup our environment by importing all needed packages:
```julia
using RxInfer, Random
```

We start by creating some dataset. For simplicity in this example we will use static pre-generated dataset. Each sample can be thought of as the outcome of single flip which is either heads or tails (1 or 0). We will assume that our virtual coin is biased, and lands heads up on 75% of the trials (on average).

```julia
n = 500  # Number of coin flips
p = 0.75 # Bias of a coin

distribution = Bernoulli(p) 
dataset      = rand(distribution, n)
```

### Model specification

In a Bayesian setting, the next step is to specify our probabilistic model. This amounts to specifying the joint probability of the random variables of the system.

#### Likelihood
We will assume that the outcome of each coin flip is governed by the Bernoulli distribution, i.e.

```math
y_i \sim \mathrm{Bernoulli}(\theta)
```

where $y_i = 1$ represents "heads", $y_i = 0$ represents "tails". The underlying probability of the coin landing heads up for a single coin flip is $\theta \in [0,1]$.

#### Prior
We will choose the conjugate prior of the Bernoulli likelihood function defined above, namely the beta distribution, i.e.

```math
\theta \sim Beta(a, b)
```

where $a$ and $b$ are the hyperparameters that encode our prior beliefs about the possible values of $\theta$. We will assign values to the hyperparameters in a later step.   

#### Joint probability
The joint probability is given by the multiplication of the likelihood and the prior, i.e.

```math
P(y_{1:N}, \theta) = P(\theta) \prod_{i=1}^N P(y_i | \theta).
```

Now let's see how to specify this model using [GraphPPL's package](https://github.com/ReactiveBayes/GraphPPL.jl) syntax:
```julia
# GraphPPL.jl export `@model` macro for model specification
# It accepts a regular Julia function and builds a factor graph under the hood
@model function coin_model(y, a, b) 
    # We endow θ parameter of our model with some prior
    θ ~ Beta(a, b)
    # We assume that outcome of each coin flip 
    # is governed by the Bernoulli distribution
    for i in eachindex(y)
        y[i] ~ Bernoulli(θ)
    end  
end
```

In short, the `@model` macro converts a textual description of a probabilistic model into a corresponding [Factor Graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_graph) (FG). In the example above, the $\theta \sim \mathrm{Beta}(a, b)$ expression creates latent variable $θ$ and assigns it as an output of $\mathrm{Beta}$ node in the corresponding factor graph. The `~` operation can be understood as _"is modelled by"_. Next, we model each data point `y[i]` as $\mathrm{Bernoulli}$ distribution with $\theta$ as its parameter.

> [!TIP]
> Alternatively, we could use the broadcasting operation:
```julia
@model function coin_model(y, a, b) 
    θ  ~ Beta(a, b)
    y .~ Bernoulli(θ) 
end
```

As you can see, `RxInfer` in combination with `GraphPPL` offers a model specification syntax that resembles closely to the mathematical equations defined above. 

### Inference specification

Once we have defined our model, the next step is to use `RxInfer` API to infer quantities of interests. To do this we can use a generic `infer` function from `RxInfer.jl` that supports static datasets.

```julia
result = infer(
    model = coin_model(a = 2.0, b = 7.0),
    data  = (y = dataset, )
)
```

# Telemetry

RxInfer collects completely anonymous telemetry data regarding package usage. This information helps us understand how RxInfer is used and shapes our roadmap to prioritize features and improvements. The telemetry:
- Does not collect any code, data, or environment information, only the fact of `using RxInfer` once per Julia session
- Entirely anonymous
- (Opt-out) Can be disabled for a single Julia session or permanently

You can learn more about it and how to opt-out by visiting our [documentation](https://docs.rxinfer.com).

## Session Sharing

RxInfer includes an optional session sharing feature that can help us provide better support and improve the package. When you encounter an issue, you can share your session data with us, which includes:
- Model source code and metadata
- Input data characteristics (no actual data)
- Execution timing and success rates
- Error information (if any)
- Environment information (Julia version, OS, etc.)

This information is invaluable for debugging issues and improving RxInfer. Session sharing is:
- Completely optional and disabled by default
- Entirely anonymous
- Only shared when you explicitly choose to do so
- (Opt-in) Can be enabled to send reports automatically when an error occurs. When enabled, still entirely anonymous.

If you're opening a GitHub issue, we encourage you to share your session ID with us - it helps us understand your use case better and provide more accurate support. Learn more about session sharing and how to opt-in in our [documentation](https://docs.rxinfer.com).
