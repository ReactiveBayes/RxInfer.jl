	abstract = {Recent advances in stochastic gradient variational inference have made it possible to perform variational Bayesian inference with posterior approximations containing auxiliary random variables. This enables us to explore a new synthesis of variational inference and Monte Carlo methods where we incorporate one or more steps of MCMC into our variational approximation. By doing so we obtain a rich class of inference algorithms bridging the gap between variational methods and MCMC, and offering the best of both worlds: fast posterior approximation through the maximization of an explicit objective, with the option of trading off additional computation for additional accuracy. We describe the theoretical foundations that make this possible and show some promising ﬁrst results.},

These models often benefit from structured, non mean field variational approximations that capture correlations between time steps. Black box variational inference with reparameterization gradients (BBVI) allows us to explore a rich new class of Bayesian non-conjugate latent time series models; however, a naive application of BBVI to such structured variational models would scale quadratically in the number of time steps. We describe a BBVI algorithm analogous to the forward-backward algorithm which instead scales linearly in time. It allows us to efficiently sample from the variational distribution and estimate the gradients of the ELBO. Finally, we show results on the recently proposed dynamic word embedding model, which was trained using our method.},

RMP is based on the reactive programming style that only describes how nodes in a factor graph react to changes in connected nodes. The absence of a fixed message passing schedule improves robustness, scalability and execution time of the inference procedure. We also present ReactiveMP.jl, which is a Julia package for realizing RMP through minimization of a constrained Bethe free energy. By user-defined specification of local form and factorization constraints on the variational posterior distribution, ReactiveMP.jl executes hybrid message passing algorithms including belief propagation, variational message passing, expectation propagation, and expectation maximisation update rules. Experimental results demonstrate the improved performance of ReactiveMP-based RMP in comparison to other Julia packages for Bayesian inference across a range of probabilistic models. In particular, we show that the RMP framework is able to run Bayesian inference for large-scale probabilistic state space models with hundreds of thousands of random variables on a standard laptop computer.},

Our method includes tracking of variational free energy (FE) as a Bayesian measure of TVAR model performance.

	abstract = {Accurate evaluation of Bayesian model evidence for a given data set is a fundamental problem in model development. Since evidence evaluations are usually intractable, in practice variational free energy (VFE) minimization provides an attractive alternative, as the VFE is an upper bound on negative model log-evidence (NLE). In order to improve tractability of the VFE, it is common to manipulate the constraints in the search space for the posterior distribution of the latent variables. Unfortunately, constraint manipulation may also lead to a less accurate estimate of the NLE. Thus, constraint manipulation implies an engineering trade-off between tractability and accuracy of model evidence estimation. In this paper, we develop a unifying account of constraint manipulation for variational inference in models that can be represented by a (Forney-style) factor graph, for which we identify the Bethe Free Energy as an approximation to the VFE. We derive well-known message passing algorithms from first principles, as the result of minimizing the constrained Bethe Free Energy (BFE). The proposed method supports evaluation of the BFE in factor graphs for model scoring and development of new message passing-based inference algorithms that potentially improve evidence estimation accuracy.},

The target application of AIDA is to propose on-the-spot the most interesting alternative values for the tuning parameters of a hearing aid (HA) algorithm, whenever a HA client is not satisfied with their HA performance. AIDA interprets searching for the "most interesting alternative" as an issue of optimal (acoustic) context-aware Bayesian trial design. In computational terms, AIDA is realized as an active inference-based agent with an Expected Free Energy criterion for trial design. This type of architecture is inspired by neuro-economic models on efficient (Bayesian) trial design in brains and implies that AIDA comprises generative probabilistic models for acoustic signals and user responses. We propose a novel generative model for acoustic signals as a sum of time-varying auto-regressive filters and a user response model based on a Gaussian Process Classifier. The full AIDA agent has been implemented in a factor graph for the generative model and all tasks (parameter learning, acoustic context classification, trial design, etc.) are realized by variational message passing on the factor graph.

Since model evidence is often an intractable quantity, the literature often resorts to computing instead the Bethe Free Energy (BFE), which for cyclefree models is a tractable upper bound on the (negative log-) model evidence. In this paper, we propose a different and faster evidence computation approach by tracking local normalization constants of sum-product messages, termed scale factors. We tabulate scale factor update rules for various elementary factor nodes and by experimental validation we verify the correctness of these update rules for models involving both discrete and continuous variables. We show how tracking scale factors leads to performance improvements compared to the traditional BFE computation approach.},

    abstract = {Stochastic approximation methods for variational inference have recently gained popularity in the probabilistic programming community since these methods are amenable to automation and allow online, scalable, and universal approximate Bayesian inference. Unfortunately, common Probabilistic Programming Languages (PPLs) with stochastic approximation engines lack the efficiency of message passing-based inference algorithms with deterministic update rules such as Belief Propagation (BP) and Variational Message Passing (VMP). Still, Stochastic Variational Inference (SVI) and Conjugate-Computation Variational Inference (CVI) provide principled methods to integrate fast deterministic inference techniques with broadly applicable stochastic approximate inference. Unfortunately, implementation of SVI and CVI necessitates manually driven variational update rules, which does not yet exist in most PPLs. In this paper, we cast SVI and CVI explicitly in a message passing-based inference context. We provide an implementation for SVI and CVI in ForneyLab, which is an automated message passing-based probabilistic programming package in the open source Julia language. Through a number of experiments, we demonstrate how SVI and CVI extends the automated inference capabilities of message passing-based probabilistic programming.}

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.07892},
	abstract = {We present ForwardDiff, a Julia package for forward-mode automatic differentiation (AD) featuring performance competitive with low-level languages like C++. Unlike recently developed AD tools in other popular high-level languages such as Python and MATLAB, ForwardDiff takes advantage of just-in-time (JIT) compilation to transparently recompile AD-unaware user code, enabling efficient support for higher-order differentiation and differentiation using custom number types (including complex numbers). For gradient and Jacobian calculations, ForwardDiff provides a variant of vector-forward mode that avoids expensive heap allocation and makes better use of memory bandwidth than traditional vector mode. In our numerical experiments, we demonstrate that for nontrivially large dimensions, ForwardDiff's gradient computations can be faster than a reverse-mode implementation from the Python-based autograd package. We also illustrate how ForwardDiff is used effectively within JuMP, a modeling language for optimization. According to our usage statistics, 41 unique repositories on GitHub depend on ForwardDiff, with users from diverse fields such as astronomy, optimization, finite element analysis, and statistics. This document is an extended abstract that has been accepted for presentation at the AD2016 7th International Conference on Algorithmic Differentiation.},
