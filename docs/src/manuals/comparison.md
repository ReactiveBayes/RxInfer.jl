# [Comparison to other packages](@id comparison)

Nowadays there's plenty of probabilistic programming languages and packages available. Although all are based on Bayesian inference, their methodologies vary. This section compares `RxInfer.jl` against other renowned probabilistic programming languages and packages. The goal is to enlighten potential users about the nuances and guide them in choosing the package that best suits their requirements.

# RxInfer.jl breakdown

- **Universality**: `RxInfer.jl` shines in formulating models derived from the exponential family distributions. The package encompasses not only commonly used distributions such as Gaussian or Bernoulli, but also specialized stochastic nodes that represents prevalent probabilistic models like Autoregressive models, Gamma Mixture models, among others. Furthermore, `RxInfer.jl` proficiently manages deterministic transformations of variables from the exponential family, see [Delta node](@ref delta-node-manual). Nevertheless, for models outside the exponential family, `RxInfer.jl` might not be the good choice. Such models would require the creation of novel nodes and corresponding rules, as illustrated [in this section](@ref create-node).
  
- **Efficiency**: `RxInfer.jl` distinguishes itself with its inference engine rooted in reactive message passing. This approach is supremely efficient, facilitating real-time propagation of updates across the system, supporting parallelization, interruptibility, and more. 

- **Modularity**: Broadly, the toolboxes in the table aren't modular in the truest sense. They don't offer the fusion of models by integrating smaller models. `RxInfer.jl` on the other hand provides a way to compose different models:
  
```@example comparison-hierarchical-models
using RxInfer #hide

@model function inner_inner(τ, y, x)
    y ~ Normal(mean = τ[1], var = τ[2] + x)
end

@model function inner(θ, α)
    β ~ Normal(mean = 0.0, var = 1.0)
    α ~ Gamma(shape = β, rate = 1.0)
    α ~ inner_inner(τ = θ, x = 3)
end

@model function outer()
    local w
    for i = 1:5
        w[i] ~ inner(θ = Gamma(shape = 1.0, rate = 1.0))
    end
    y ~ inner(θ = w[2:3])
end
```

- **Expressiveness**: `RxInfer.jl` empowers users to elegantly and concisely craft models, closely mirroring probabilistic notation, thanks to Julia's macro capabilities.

!!! note
    RxInfer uses `:=` for deterministic relationships (see [Using `=` instead of `:=` for deterministic nodes](@ref usage-colon-equality)) which might differ from other frameworks but enables powerful message-passing capabilities.

To illustrate the expressiveness, let's consider the following model:

$$\begin{aligned}
 x & \sim \mathrm{Normal}(0.0, 1.0)\\
 w & \sim \mathrm{InverseGamma}(1.0, 1.0)\\
 y & \sim \mathrm{Normal}(x, w)
\end{aligned}$$

The model then is expressed in `RxInfer.jl` as follows:
```@example comparison-expresiveness
using RxInfer #hide

@model function example_model()
    x ~ Normal(mean = 0.0, var = 1.0)
    w ~ InverseGamma(α = 1, θ = 1)
    y ~ Normal(mean = x, var = w)
end
```

- **Debugging & Visualization**: `RxInfer.jl` does provide a mechanism to debug the inference [procedure](@ref user-guide-debugging) and [visualise](https://reactivebayes.github.io/GraphPPL.jl/stable/) the graph structure, even though not as seamlessly as some other packages.
